# build-a-formic-form-example
## This is a basic example of formic form.

Instruction on how to run:

Download and unzip the folder/files. The folder public/index.html (this is where your React app will be loaded inside the root element).
src/App.js (this is the main component of your React application. This is where most of your code will go).
Open a command line on your computer and run the command cd path/to/project/root, which allows you to point to the root folder of the starter files (note that path/to/project/root should be replaced with the actual path to the starter files).
Within the same command-line window, run npm install to install all dependencies
Once the command completes successfully, run npm start to start the application in your browser.
Use NVM version 14.20.0.
